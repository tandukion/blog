## Overview
Musculoskeletal robot is a robot that mimics a muscular and skeletal system of a bioligical creature (not necessarily human).
One key feature of the musculoskeletal robot is the utilization of artifical muscle actuators.
The actuators replace the common electric motor actuator to gain similar property with the muscle.
The main property which the actuators aim is the muscle compliance.
There are several type of actuators designed for a musculoskeletal humanoid, where the objective of each actuator may have different purpose.

### Series Elastic Actuator (SEA)
Series elastic actuator (SEA) consists of motor and spring.
SEA has compliance and energy strage features from the spring.
However, the compliance may be fixed, due to the spring constant.
